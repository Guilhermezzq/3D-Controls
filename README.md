# 3D Controls and Their Properties
This repository is intended to provide a collection of 3D controls and their properties to facilitate interaction with three-dimensional objects in virtual environments. These controls are especially useful for visualization and manipulation of 3D models in applications such as games, simulations, and virtual reality environments.

# Available Controls:
## Grid:
 Description: A grid system that provides a visual structure for spatial reference.
 Properties: Configurable size, spacing, color, and opacity.
# CameraControls:
Description: Allows users to control the position and orientation of the virtual camera.
Properties: Rotation, panning, and zooming movement, rotation speed, mouse/touchpad sensitivity.
# useControls:
Description: A custom hook to easily integrate controls into React applications or other frameworks.
Properties: Simplified interface to configure and use controls in 3D components.
# Zoom Truck (Vertical and Horizontal Zoom):
Description: Facilitates vertical and horizontal zooming on specific objects or the entire scene.
Properties: Zoom factor, zoom speed, zoom limits.
# Vertical and Horizontal (Vertical and Horizontal Rotation):
Description: Allows vertical and horizontal rotation of objects in the scene.
Properties: Rotation speed, rotation limits, rotation axes.
